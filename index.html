    <p>
      Queen Mary 2 is a remarkable flagship, and her style and elegance are legendary. Above all, it is the space she offers and the luxury for you to do as little or as much as you
      wish which set her apart. Queen Mary 2 is the flagship of Cunard Line. She was constructed to replace the ageing Queen Elizabeth 2, which was the Cunard flagship from 1969 to 2004 and the last major ocean liner built before Queen Mary 2. Queen Mary 2 had the Royal Mail Ship (RMS) prefix conferred on her by the Royal Mail when she entered service in 2004, as a gesture to Cunard's history.[14]
      Queen Mary 2 is not a steamship like many of her predecessors, but is powered primarily by four diesel engines.
